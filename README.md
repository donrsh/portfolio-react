# React Portfolio

This site serves as a portfolio of my react skill.
It is based on Vite, and also an app under my [web apps workspace](https://github.com/donrsh/web-apps-workspace/tree/main) project.

## How to Start It on Local Machine?

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/donrsh/web-apps-workspace.git # clone workspace
$ cd web-apps-workspace
$ pnpm install
$ cd apps && git clone https://github.com/donrsh/portfolio-react.git # clone project
$ cd portfolio-react
$ pnpm install-deps
$ pnpm dev
```
